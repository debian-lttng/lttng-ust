libustinstr-malloc is used for instrumenting calls to malloc(3) in a program,
without need for recompiling it.

libustinstr-malloc defines a malloc() function that is instrumented with a
marker. It also calls the libc malloc afterwards. When loaded with LD_PRELOAD,
it replaces the libc malloc() function, in effect instrumenting all calls to
malloc().

See the "run" script for a usage example.
