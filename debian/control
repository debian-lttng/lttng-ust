Description: LTTng 2.0 Userspace Tracer (libraries)
 The userspace tracer is designed to provide detailed information about
 userspace activity. Like the kernel tracer, performance is the main goal.
 Tracing does not require system calls or traps. UST instrumentation points may
 be added in any userspace code including signal handlers and libraries.
 .
 This package contains the UST runtime libraries needed to execute applications
 linked against liblttng-ust.
