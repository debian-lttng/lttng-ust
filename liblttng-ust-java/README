This directory contains a simple API for instrumenting java applications.

Configuration examples to build this library:

dependency: sun-java6-jdk
./configure --with-java-jdk=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun --with-jni-interface

dependency: openjdk-6-jdk
./configure --with-java-jdk=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk --with-jni-interface

dependency: gcj-4.4-jdk
./configure --with-java-jdk=/usr/lib/jvm/java-gcj --with-jni-interface


After building, you can use the liblttng-ust-java.jar file in a Java project.
It requires the liblttng-ust-java.so* files (which get installed when doing
`make install') so make sure those are in the linker's library path.
