PACKAGE CONTENTS:

  This package contains the following elements.

  - libust
    The actual userspace tracing library that must be linked to the
    instrumented programs.

  - ustctl
    A program to control the tracing of userspace applications. It can list
    markers, start the tracing, stop the tracing, enable/disable markers, etc.

  - include
    The public header files that will be installed on the system.

  - ust-consumerd
    The daemon that collects trace data and writes it to the disk.

  - doc
    The documentation.

  - tests
    Various test programs

  - libustinstr-malloc
    An example library that can be LD_PRELOAD'ed to instrument calls to malloc()
    in any program without need to recompile it.

  - libustfork
    A library that is LD_PRELOAD'ed, and that hijacks calls to several system
    calls in order to trace across these calls. It _has_ to be LD_PRELOAD'ed
    in order to hijack calls. In contrast, libust may be linked at build time.

  - libustctl
    A library to control tracing in other processes. Used by ustctl.

  - libustcomm
    A static library shared between libust, ust-consumerd and libustctl, that
    provides functions that allow these components to communicate together.

  - libustconsumer
    A library to create ust consumers by registering callbacks, used by
    ust-consumerd.

  - snprintf
    An asynchronous signal-safe version of snprintf.

  - java
    A simple library that uses JNI to allow tracing in java programs.
